						Suffix Tree

Implementation of a Generalized Suffix Tree in python for Advanced Algorithms Assignment II. 

AesopTales.txt is input file for this implementation of a Generalized Suffix Tree and it gives results pertaining to the stories
in the AesopTales.txt.

This Generalized Suffix Tree adds words and not complete sentences to search in the Suffix Tree as it gives a lower height to the
Suffix Tree.

Changes may be made to this code in the future to make the running more efficient, if you face any bugs or errors, please report it
and I will look into it.

While the client.py checks for version details, this implementation runs on Python 3.6.1

Please use the AesopTales.txt provided with this archive as the original AesopTales.txt has some formatting issues.
